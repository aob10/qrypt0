# qrypt0

qrypt0 is a system to exchange messages encrypted by a computer which is permanently offline. The ciphertext is transferred to an online computer by encoding it into a QR code and scanning it off the screen. 

This system provides an effective defence against one of the most common attacks on secure communication: the circumvention of encryption. By computer network exploitation, the attacker installs malware on the target computer. When a message is typed in, a keylogger can intercept and pass it on before encryption is applied. 

qrypt0 requires every user to keep an additional computer offline and physically secure. As long as there are no operating systems which can be secured effectively, this is one way to restrict successful attacks to breaking the encryption itself rather than exploiting operating system vulnerabilities.
